1)creating and manupulating directories

create a directory in the working directory "~" called 'programs'
-mkdir programms

create 2 directories in the directory in programs directory called "homework1" and "homework2"
-mkdir programms/homework1 programs/homework2

create 1 directory in "homework2" directory called "subhomeworkA"
-mkdir programs/homework2/subhomeworkA

rename the previously created directory to "homework2-subhomeworkA"
-mv programs/homework2/subhomeworkA programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA

2)creating and manipulating files

create 3 files in the directory "~/programs" called "program1.c" "program2.c" "program2.h"
-touch ~/programs/program1.c ~/programs/program2.c ~/programs/program2.h

create 2 files in the "~/programs/homework1" directory called "homework1-2.c" "homework1-1.c"
-touch ~/programs/homework1/homework1-1.c ~/programs/homework1/homework1-1.c

create 2 files with the name subhomeworkA1.c and subhomeworkA2.cpp in the ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA directory
-touch ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA1.c ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA2.cpp

create 2 aliases in the directory ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA such that
    -homework2-subhomeworkA1.c is a normal link of subhomeworkA1.c
    -homework2-subhomeworkA2.cpp is a symbolic link of subhomeworkA2.cpp
-ln ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA1.c ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/homework2-subhomeworkA1.c -s ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA2.c ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/homework2-subhomeworkA2.c

copy the ~/programs/homework1/homework1-1.c file to the ~/programs/homework2 directory with the name homework2-1.c
-cp ~/programs/homework1/homework1-1.c ~/programs/homework2/homework2-1.c

move the ~/programs/homework1/homework1-2.c file to the ~/programs/homework2 directory with the name homework2-2.c
-mv ~/programs/homework1/homework1-2.c ~/programs/homework2/homework2-2.c

delete one of the following files: subhomeworkA1.c or homework2-subhomeworkA1.c
-rm ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA1.c
or
-rm ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/homework2-subhomeworkA1.c

3) About cut

write a command that only displays the GID of every user
-cut -d: -f4 /etc/passwd

4) About grep

write a command that displays only users from the 
-grep :0: /etc/groups

5) About stat

write a command that shows how many aliases has a given file file
-stat -c "%h" ~/programs/homework2/homework2-subhomeworkA/subhomeworkA2.c
