Commands used in these excercises:

sort - displays the contents of a file in a sorted manner
find - finds something from a specified directory.

Something that you need to know:

parameters used in sort:

-t: specifies a delimiter
-n: sortes lines of a file numerically (by default, it sorts lexico-gramatically)
-r: sorting in descending order
-k: specify the row you want to sort.

parameters used in find:

-type: specify the file type you want to find.
Example:
    f - normal file
    d - directory
    l - links

-used: specify the range of last accessed file in days.
-perm: specify the access rights (more on that later)
-printf: customize the console output of executing the command (in a simmilar manner as the printf function in C):
    -%h - displays the directory the file belongs
    -%f - displays the file name
    -%t - displays the last modified date 
    -%M - displays the file permissions (the -rwxrwxrwx format)
    -%k - displays the size in Kb
    -%m - displays the file permissions (octal format)
-name: specify the pattern of a file
-o/or: the "or" logical operator. Used to find multiple files with different patterns
-size: find the files that have a specified file size:
    - less than
    + greater than
-exec: executes a command based on what find command found:
    {} - the placeholder name of the file.
    \, ; - I have no idea what it does, but you have to put them at the end to work properly
-delete: deletes every instance the command find found

of course, these are only a fraction of many possible uses of the find command. Refer to the
usage of this command to "man find"

About file permissions:

a file or directory has some internal data that specifies who is allowed to acces it.

It is usually displayed as a string:

   u   g   o
- rwx rwx rwx, where:
    r - read access
    w - write access
    x - execution access
and it is separated in 3 segments all representing:
    owner of the file rights - u
    group that the file can acces it - g
    everybody else - o

or octal:
 ugo
0777 where:

    1 = x
    2 = w
    4 = r

specific commands regarding the file's ownership:
    chmod - changes the file permissions (in a string format or octal)
    chown - changes the owner of the file
