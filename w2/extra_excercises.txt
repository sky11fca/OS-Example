TL;DR: From now on, the excersises from course will split into ones that 
you get parks for that day's activity, and extra ones.

The extra batch of excersises is usually put there to get bonus points

If you don't get the minimum points to pass this course, you don't
get the points.

I reccomend doing these type of excercises because these have the
unfortunate luck to appear in midterms and session exams.

1)find 5
Write a command that displays every file and directory, as well as the execution
rights of it, and only the ones which the group has the read and execution rights
-find ~ -type f,d -perm -g=rx -printf "%h/%f %M\n"

2)find 6
Write a command that displays C/C++ files (ones that end in .c .cpp .h)
and display the last modified date and their dimensions (in octal)
-find ~ -type f \( -name "*.c" -o -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" \) -printf "%h/%f -> %m\n"


3)find 7
Write a command that finds the C++ files (.cpp) from the home directory
and compiles the one that have their size <5Kb. Any error will be redirected
to a file named errors.txt
-find ~ -type f -name "*cpp" -size -5k -exec g++ {} -o {}_compiled \; 2> error.txt

4)find 8
Write a command that finds web related files (.html .htm .php .css) 
and display the size in Kb and last modified date
-find ~ -type f \( -name "*.hml" -or -name "*.html" -or -name "*.php" -or -name "*.css" \) -printf "%h/%f -> %kKb -> %t\n"

5)find 9
Write a command that finds temporary files (~ .bak) and deletes them from 
the home directory
-find ~ -type f \( -name "*~" -or -name "*.bak" \) -delete

6)find 10
Write a command that shows only the hard links, displayed by the name of said link.
-find ~ -type l -exec ls -l {} \; 
(I'm litterally not sure what this excercise wants)
